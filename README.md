## maNUAL chaRMM (macha)

#### Installation

macha is available as a conda package and can be installed in any conda environment with:

`conda install -c johanneskarwou -c conda-forge macha`


#### Please note:
This an early incarnation of meta scripts, which may or may not be suitable for general use. 
We assume no responsibility for your use of the provided code.
The macha CLI interface assumes that you are working in a folder containing input scripts 
generated by CHARMM-GUI (https://charmm-gui.org/) and was designed to work with these scripts
in the state they were provided in the years 2022-2023.

#### Usage:
The CLI interface intends to keep up with developments in the Python backend, but may not
always be up to date. Please inspect and/or use/modify the python scripts directly if you
encounter problems.

It is necessary to set a few variables in the top of the CLI script for it to work on your setup!

It is recommended to set an alias for the CLI script for convenient usage, e.g. in your .bashrc:

\# Make sure that the charmm binary is in the $PATH or you have set a location in the script.

export PATH="/path/to/charmm/bin:$PATH"

\# Create an alias for the script e.g. in your .bashrc .

alias macha="/path/to/manual_charmm_system_setup.sh"
